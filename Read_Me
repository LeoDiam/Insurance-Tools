I created some tools that will help insurance agents, brokers and financail consultunts perform better.

Both tools have two version:
1) Desktop Application
2) Android Application

First tool is about a tool that calculates total national and compensational pension based on age, years worked and years until pension.
Secondly it calculates how much you need to save per month to get the pension you really wanted.
Finally it makes your life easy demonstrating how much easier this would become if you used an investment program with revenue.
This tool obviously help insurance agents explain those benefits to the client easier and more sufficiently.

Second tool is about life insurance cost per year calculation.
As described before it calculates the cost per year based on your age and profession.
In addition it helps you understand your real needs using the latest stats after asking for client's number of childs, income, loans and fortune.
